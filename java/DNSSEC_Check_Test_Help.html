<h1>Test Results String</h1>
<p>The results string has 13 characters that from left to right correspond to the 13 tests described in the table below.
The leftmost letter in the string corresponds to test 1 (T1), the second letter to test 2, and so forth.  Each character
in the string is a letter from the following list:
<ul>
<li>S - test skipped
<li>T - test timed out
<li>A - test passed and the Authoritative Data (AD) flag bit is set in the response
<li>P - test passed and the AD flag bit is not set
<li>F - test failed and the AD flag bit is not set
<li>X - test failed and the AD flag bit is set 
</ul>
